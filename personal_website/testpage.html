  <h2>Why Characters Seem Real</h2>
  <p>If you go online, you can buy yourself a t-shirt printed with the question “What Would Elizabeth Bennet Do?” The correct answer is nothing. Elizabeth Bennet, heroine of Jane Austen’s <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, is a collection of words printed on paper. She cannot do anything. Yet this doesn’t stop people from thinking about her like she is a real person; in this case, imagining how she would behave in their situation. Existing literary scholarship has explained this phenomena of the perceived realness of characters by reference to thought report, which is the narration of the thoughts and feelings of a character. However, this approach does not explain why certain characters primarily narrated through physical description and behaviour, such as Sherlock Holmes, have been perceived as the most real to lay-readers.
  </p>
  <p>My dissertation uses psychological research on how we interpret the behaviour of people in real life to explain how descriptions of the behaviour of fictional characters prompts us to think about them in the same way as a real human being. In doing so, I challenge the conventional literary historiography of perceived character realness, in which increasing psychological realism via thought report culminates in high modernism. By tracing behaviour descriptions through characters noted for seeming real, I unearth an alternate history of this phenomenon from early realism to the emergence of genre fiction in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, one which accounts for characters the previous model did not. I combine this cognitive literary studies approach with computational text analysis and archival research to offer an unprecedented interdisciplinary study of the phenomenon of perceived character realness.  Ultimately, this project significantly revises and broadens how we understand the way representations of people in art affect human psychology, with tangible ramifications for politics, social cohesion and individual development.
