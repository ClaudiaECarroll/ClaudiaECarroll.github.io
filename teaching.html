    <h2>Classes Taught</h2>
    <p><b>The Historical Novel</b> <em>(Spring 2020)</em></p>
    <p>James Cameron's Titanic, Netflix's The Crown, even Game of Thrones - our popular culture is saturated with stories based on the real events of the past, be they attempting "historical accuracy" or blending history with fiction and even fantasy. The tradition of creating compelling stories using the raw material of the past is an established one in human history. This course will explore this tradition in the context of the modern novel. We will begin with Walter Scott's Waverly, often cited as the first historical novel, and progress through a selection of major historical novels of the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty first centuries, spanning three continents and six countries. As we read we will consider key questions respecting the relationship between history and historical fiction: What is the difference between historical narrative and fictional narrative? How can novels offer a different kind of perspective on history that "objective" history writing cannot? Why has historical fiction in many cases proven more impactful in shaping perceptions of the past than academic historical research? What is meant by "historical accuracy" and why do people care so much about it in fictional works? In the course of exploring these questions we will also consider broader issues of historical representation, such as the depiction of war, colonialism and national identity. At the heart of our course will be the matter of how we as individuals and as a society perceive our own and other's pasts, and what impact that perception has on our present.</p>

    <p><b>Writing and Rhetoric: Rhetoric of the Everyday</b> <em>(Fall 2019/Spring 2020)</em></p>
    <p>In the 21st century, our day-to-day lives are saturated with rhetorical tasks: convincing a
university advisor that you should take a certain class, telling a story in a way that makes your
friends laugh, interviewing for a job. All of these experiences require us to present ourselves and
our position in a certain way, in order to achieve a certain effect in our audience, which will in
turn, hopefully, lead to a desire or ambition being fulfilled. By working through a variety of
examples of rhetoric in practice, including political speeches, novels, trial defenses and YouTube
videos, we will consider how we can persuade people of something, but also the ethical
responsibilities of that power of persuasion. Assignments to this end will include a rhetorical
analysis paper, an interpretive argument paper, and a research paper. This class is primarily
geared toward training you to become effective writers in a university context; however the
rhetorical skills you will come to understand and deploy over the course of the semester will
allow you to better understand how you already communicate, and make that communication
more effective</p>

<p><b>Basics of Film and Television</b> <em>(Fall 2018/Fall 2020)</em> (TA to Prof. Chris Becker)</p>
<p>This class introduces majors in Film, Television and Theatre to the foundational concepts and methods in film criticism. The class inroduces students to narrative and style analysis, including act structure, perspective, cinematography, and sound. We also offer an overview of US film and TV production institutions (the studio system, independent cinema network television, streaming content providers, etc.) My role in this class was to teach two weekly discussion sections of 10-20 students, review assignments and papers with students, and be the first point of contact for any student concerns with the course material.
